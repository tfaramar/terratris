# Welcome to Terratris! 
### Like Tetris, but a little cuter


## Why Tetris?

The game of Tetris has been around for more than 35 years. Although, many variations have been made, the classic game remains the most popular precisely because of its simplicity. I’ve never found a particularly appealing skin for Tetris, so I decided to make one I'd like to play with. 


## Gameplay

Nothing too complicated here. In gameplay, pieces of different geometries will descend from the top of the screen. You can move them laterally and rotate them, but your job is to organize them so that they form horizontal blocks across the bottom of the board, which will disappear once complete. Try to keep the board from filling with pieces! This will get progressively harder as you level up and the pieces begin falling more quickly.

Here are a few commands to get you started:

* The left and right arrows move the falling piece laterally
* The down arrow accelerates the drop of the falling piece
* The spacebar "hard-drops" the falling piece
* The p key pauses the game



## Implementation

This version of Tetris was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a few days' time. 


## Future features

My primary goal was to create a clean, well-functioning game of Tetris. However, if I decide to return to this project, I'd like to implement the following:

* The awarding of bombs, in singles or pairs, based on the user’s lines cleared. The bombs can also be moved laterally by the user, and will destroy the first block that they make direct contact with.
* A cooperative two-player option, in which two blocks will fall at a time, and users can use different parts of the keyboard to control each piece.
